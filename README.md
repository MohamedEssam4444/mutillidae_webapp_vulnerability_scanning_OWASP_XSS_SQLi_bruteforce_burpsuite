## Steps:

1. SQL injection :

* The SQL Injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their name and instead of a name they give you a MySQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database.

* using this command `mohamed' OR 6=6; -- select* from accounts` where i entered any user then (') after the user as (') one of sql known commands to make user run sql query into db instead of just matching records then had to make the sql command right to be executed correctly so entered OR 6=6; so that it's a right sql command as 6=6 and then execute select all from accounts to get all account records

2. Cross-site scripting (XSS):

* Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application.
* Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data.
* How does XSS work?
* Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, the attacker can fully compromise their interaction with the application.

* **Reflected** :where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.
* Example:

* **Dom**: where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code

3. Broken Authentication via bruteforce using Burp Suite (login):

* A brute force attack uses trial-and-error to guess login info, encryption keys, or find a hidden web page. Hackers work through all possible combinations hoping to guess correctly.

* These attacks are done by ‘brute force’ meaning they use excessive forceful attempts to try and ‘force’ their way into your private account(s).

* Burp Suite Professional is one of the most popular penetration testing and vulnerability finder tools, and is often used for checking web application security. “Burp,” as it is commonly known, is a proxy-based tool used to evaluate the security of web-based applications and do hands-on testing

* **Login**:

* **Scanning webapp by burpsuite and getting the user and password entered**:

* **sending result to intruder**

* **User payload trials , trying many users and encapsulating them in the first payload**

* **Successful attack and got 302 status code which with small length which indicates that this is the right user and password combination and the attacker can login using this**
